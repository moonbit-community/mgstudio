# Moon Game Studio Page

`mgstudio-page` is a static website for showcasing engine examples in the browser.

This folder is intentionally **not** the web runtime.
The web runtime lives in `mgstudio-runtime/web` and its only job is producing the
JavaScript bundle.

## Build

```bash
./build.sh
```

The output is written to `dist/`.

## Serve Locally

```bash
./serve.sh
```
